# AdventOfCode2022

The Goal for this year was merely to complete as many puzzles as possible using Python. This was just after I learned coding in a Numerical Analysis Class and thus 
was only looking to see how far I could go. I was not focusing on readability or commenting so I apologize if any of this code is hard to understand.
